# SQLPractice
This repository is used to show my understanding of SQL and how I use certain sql techniques to answer insightful questions

# [SQL Project 1](https://reecealbert.github.io/SQLPractice/)
The first project inside this section is a basic understanding of sql. The use of SELECT,FROM,GROUP BY, and ORDER BY were displayed. I want to show that I have a basic understanding of the basic sql functions. Hope you enjoy looking through the project. 
The project also allowed me to create question that I wanted to answer about the data.
The dataset came from kaggle and I conveted it to an sql.doc
