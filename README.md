# SQL Projects
This repository is used to show my understanding of SQL and how I use certain sql techniques to answer insightful questions

# [SQL Project 1](https://reecealbert.github.io/SQLPractice/)
The first project inside this section is a basic understanding of sql. The use of SELECT,FROM,GROUP BY, and ORDER BY were displayed. I want to show that I have a basic understanding of the basic sql functions. Hope you enjoy looking through the project. 
The project also allowed me to create question that I wanted to answer about the data.
The dataset came from kaggle and I conveted it to an sql.doc

# [SQL Project 2](https://reecealbert.github.io/SQLPractice/)
This project is based on the NFL draft. The draft happens every year for every NFL team. The hope to draft or sign college players that will fit their system and their playstyle. I wanted to look more in-depth into the NFL draft to understand more about the different positions,collegiate teams, players, etc. I upload a csv file of NFL draft data to SQL. This data has 5 tables that represent the last 5 NFL drafts. The use of group by, window functions, order by, etc. was displayed inside of this project. When looking through the files on my github, you will see the top line of the sql code represent what I am trying to look for. I will try and put a summary of each code snippet below. This data contain 5 different tables

# DATA:

1.[NFL Draft 2019](https://github.com/ReeceAlbert/SQLPractice/blob/main/nfldraft2019.csv)
2.[NFL Draft 2020](https://github.com/ReeceAlbert/SQLPractice/blob/main/nfldraft2020.csv)
3.[NFL Draft 2021](https://github.com/ReeceAlbert/SQLPractice/blob/main/nfldraft2021.csv)
4.[NFL Draft 2022](https://github.com/ReeceAlbert/SQLPractice/blob/main/nfldraft2022.csv)
5.[NFL Draft 2023](https://github.com/ReeceAlbert/SQLPractice/blob/main/nfldraft2023.csv)



# Questions for Analysis 

1. See what what conf has the highest % of 1st rounders,2nd rounders,etc.
2. I wanted to break down the each draft and see which Power 5 conference had the highest % of draft picks.(Power 5 = SEC,Pac-12,Big 12,ACC,Big 10. I did this for the last 5 drafts)
3. Which position is geared towards the first round over the past 5 drafts, i.e Which position had the most players drafted in a certain round
4. Which side of the ball has more draft picks (Offense or Defense or Special Teams)
5. Total amount for each position over the past 5 drafts i.e Which position had the most drafted players over the past 5 drafts
6. Which nfl team had the most draft picks over the last 5 drafts
7. Which college team had the most drafts picks over the past 5 drafts
8. Which Power 5 conferences and Non Power 5 conferences had more offense or defense players drafted
9. Which side of the ball has more draft picks (Offense or Defense or Special Teams)
