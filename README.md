# SQL Projects
This repository is used to show my understanding of SQL and how I use certain sql techniques to answer insightful questions

# [SQL Project 1](https://reecealbert.github.io/SQLPractice/)
The first project inside this section is a basic understanding of sql. The use of SELECT,FROM,GROUP BY, and ORDER BY were displayed. I want to show that I have a basic understanding of the basic sql functions. Hope you enjoy looking through the project. 
The project also allowed me to create question that I wanted to answer about the data.
The dataset came from kaggle and I conveted it to an sql.doc

# [SQL Project 2](https://reecealbert.github.io/SQLPractice/)
This project is based on the NFL draft. The draft happens every year for every NFL team. The hope to draft or sign college players that will fit their system and their playstyle. I wanted to look more in-depth into the NFL draft to understand more about the different positions,collegiate teams, players, etc. I upload a csv file of NFL draft data to SQL. This data has 5 tables that represent the last 5 NFL drafts. The use of group by, window functions, order by, etc. was displayed inside of this project.

There's been a Murder in SQL City! The SQL Murder Mystery is designed to be both a self-directed lesson to learn SQL concepts and commands and a fun game for experienced SQL users to solve an intriguing crime.

A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.
I personally used this data to find out who did the murder
