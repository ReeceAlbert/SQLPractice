# SQL Projects
This repository is used to show my understanding of SQL and how I use certain sql techniques to answer insightful questions

# [SQL Project 1](https://reecealbert.github.io/SQLPractice/)
The first project inside this section is a basic understanding of sql. The use of SELECT,FROM,GROUP BY, and ORDER BY were displayed. I want to show that I have a basic understanding of the basic sql functions. Hope you enjoy looking through the project. 
The project also allowed me to create question that I wanted to answer about the data.
The dataset came from kaggle and I conveted it to an sql.doc

# [SQL Project 2](https://reecealbert.github.io/SQLPractice/)
This project is based on the NFL draft. The draft happens every year for every NFL team. The hope to draft or sign college players that will fit their system and their playstyle. I wanted to look more in-depth into the NFL draft to understand more about the different positions,collegiate teams, players, etc. I upload a csv file of NFL draft data to SQL. This data has 5 tables that represent the last 5 NFL drafts. The use of group by, window functions, order by, etc. was displayed inside of this project.
